# üéØ Chapter 03 Checkpoint: Advanced Container Management

Test your understanding of advanced Docker container management concepts and practical skills.

## üìù Knowledge Assessment

### Section A: Container Architecture (25 points)

**Question 1 (5 points):** What are the key differences between Docker containers and virtual machines in terms of resource usage and isolation?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
- **Containers:** Share host OS kernel, lighter weight, process-level isolation using namespaces and cgroups
- **Virtual Machines:** Each VM includes full guest OS, heavier resource usage, hardware-level isolation
- **Resource Usage:** Containers use less memory/CPU overhead, faster startup times
- **Isolation:** VMs provide stronger isolation, containers provide sufficient isolation for most use cases
</details>

---

**Question 2 (5 points):** Explain the role of Linux namespaces and control groups (cgroups) in container isolation.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
- **Namespaces provide isolation:**
  - PID: Process ID isolation
  - NET: Network interface isolation
  - MNT: Mount point isolation
  - UTS: Hostname isolation
  - IPC: Inter-process communication isolation
  - USER: User and group ID isolation

- **Control Groups (cgroups) provide resource limits:**
  - CPU: Processing power limits
  - Memory: RAM usage limits
  - Block I/O: Disk operation limits
  - Network: Bandwidth limits
</details>

---

**Question 3 (5 points):** What are the different container lifecycle states and how do you transition between them?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
- **States:** Created ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Paused ‚Üí Stopped ‚Üí Removed
- **Transitions:**
  - `docker create` ‚Üí Created
  - `docker start` ‚Üí Running
  - `docker pause` ‚Üí Paused
  - `docker unpause` ‚Üí Running
  - `docker stop` ‚Üí Stopped
  - `docker rm` ‚Üí Removed
</details>

---

**Question 4 (5 points):** How do you configure memory limits and what happens when a container exceeds them?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
```bash
# Memory limit configuration
docker run --memory=512m myapp

# Additional memory options
docker run --memory=512m --memory-swap=1g --memory-swappiness=60 myapp

# OOM kill protection (use carefully)
docker run --memory=256m --oom-kill-disable myapp
```

**When exceeded:** Container gets killed by OOM (Out of Memory) killer with exit code 137
</details>

---

**Question 5 (5 points):** What are the different Docker networking modes and when would you use each?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
- **Bridge (default):** Isolated network with port mapping, good for single-host applications
- **Host:** Shares host network stack, best performance but less isolation
- **None:** No network access, for completely isolated applications
- **Container:** Shares network with another container, useful for sidecar patterns
- **Custom networks:** User-defined networks for better container communication
</details>

---

### Section B: Resource Management (25 points)

**Question 6 (5 points):** Write Docker commands to run a container with the following resource constraints:
- Maximum 2 CPU cores
- 1GB memory limit
- CPU pinned to cores 0 and 1
- Block I/O read limit of 10MB/s

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --cpus="2" \
  --memory=1g \
  --cpuset-cpus="0,1" \
  --device-read-bps /dev/sda:10mb \
  myapp:latest
```
</details>

---

**Question 7 (5 points):** How do you monitor real-time resource usage of containers and what key metrics should you track?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
docker stats
docker stats mycontainer --no-stream

# Key metrics to track:
# - CPU percentage
# - Memory usage and percentage
# - Network I/O (RX/TX)
# - Block I/O (read/write)
# - PIDs (process count)
```
</details>

---

**Question 8 (5 points):** What's the difference between `--cpu-shares` and `--cpus` options?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
- **`--cpus`:** Hard limit on CPU cores (e.g., `--cpus="1.5"` = max 1.5 cores)
- **`--cpu-shares`:** Relative weight for CPU scheduling (default 1024, higher = more priority)
- **Usage:** `--cpus` for absolute limits, `--cpu-shares` for relative prioritization
</details>

---

**Question 9 (5 points):** How do you implement CPU pinning and when is it beneficial?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
```bash
# CPU pinning to specific cores
docker run --cpuset-cpus="0,1,2" myapp
docker run --cpuset-cpus="0-3" myapp

# Memory node pinning (NUMA)
docker run --cpuset-mems="0" myapp

# Benefits: Reduces context switching, better cache locality, predictable performance
```
</details>

---

**Question 10 (5 points):** Explain memory reservation vs memory limit in Docker.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer:**
- **Memory Limit (`--memory`):** Hard limit, container killed if exceeded
- **Memory Reservation (`--memory-reservation`):** Soft limit, suggestion for scheduler
- **Usage:** Reservation for flexible allocation, limit for protection
```bash
docker run --memory=1g --memory-reservation=512m myapp
```
</details>

### Exercise 2: Health Check Implementation (20 points)

1. **Basic Health Check (5 points):** Create a web application with `/health` endpoint that returns 200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy.

2. **Advanced Health Check (10 points):** Implement a health check that validates:
   - Application responds within 3 seconds
   - Database connection is working
   - Disk usage is below 90%
   - Memory usage is below 85%
