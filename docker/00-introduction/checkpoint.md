### Part 3: Real-World Applications (30 points)

#### Question 8 (15 points)
**Scenario:** You're working on a team project where developers use different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and different versions of Node.js. How would containers solve this problem?

**Your answer (3-4 sentences):**
```
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
```

#### Question 9 (15 points)
**List three real-world benefits of using containers in production environments:**

1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________
3. ________________________________________________

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Assessment

### Task 1: Container Analysis (Bonus 20 points)

Run the following commands and explain what each does:

```bash
docker run hello-world
docker run -it ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine
docker ps -a
```

**Command explanations:**

1. `docker run hello-world`:
   ```
   ________________________________________________
   ________________________________________________
   ```

2. `docker run -it ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash`:
   ```
   ________________________________________________
   ________________________________________________
   ```

3. `docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine`:
   ```
   ________________________________________________
   ________________________________________________
   ```

4. `docker ps -a`:
   ```
   ________________________________________________
   ________________________________________________
   ```

## üéØ Mini Project Challenge

### Project: Environment Comparison

**Objective:** Demonstrate the difference between running applications directly vs. in containers.

**Instructions:**

1. **Without containers:** Try to install and run a simple web server (like nginx) directly on your machine
2. **With containers:** Run the same web server using Docker
3. **Compare:** Document the differences in setup time, complexity, and cleanup

**Deliverable:** Write a brief comparison (5-6 sentences) highlighting the key differences:

```
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
________________________________________________
```
